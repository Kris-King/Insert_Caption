    We're a small company based in San Francisco. We were originally based in Los Angeles but 
    when operations expanded and space was an issue we moved to bigger offices in San Francisco. 
    We continue to support our users from the day we setup our website and will continue 
    to provide that excellence service for years to come. It is our hope to create more site's 
    dedicated to user interaction in the future.

    Our team consists of very talented designers and developers who stride to provide our
    users with an outlet to express their humor. Started in 2013, Insert Caption began as a
    site to provide other users access to free licensed images. It was the purpose
    of the site to give other users the ability to post their amusing images
    so users could take them and share them with others.

    By mid 2014 the site had a very positive reaction with users but the site remained 
    quite restricted and there was no way for users to comment on these images. With the
    growing number of users to this site we thought it necessary to expand our site to allow 
    registered users to caption images submitted by others. With this new feature, users 
    can now provide their own captions to any images they see on this site. We hope
    this gives our users the opportunity to be as creative as they can and provide some very
    funny quips.

<p>
    From the team here at Insert Caption we hope you have a great experience and continue to
    provide other users with some great images and captions. We would also like to thank you 
    for using our site and hope you will continue to do so in the future.
